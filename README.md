## About

This tool is a savedata editor for the game Saint Seiya: Sanctuary Battle, also known as Saint Seiya Senki.<br />
Currently, you can edit some stats from any character in the game, including DLC characters. More features are planned.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## For PlayStation 3

The SAVEDATA file is encrypted and must be decrypted before using this tool.

Back in my [SSSS Tools repository](https://github.com/Erik-JS/SSSS_Tools), I mentioned that you should use Bruteforce Save Data in order to decrypt and re-encrypt your save files.<br />
If you can't find BSD or can't make it run, for whatever reason, you can instead search for [PS3] Save Resigner and use it instead. That's the tool I'm currently using.

Even if you have a PS3 with OFW, you can still hack your savegames without problem. I'm aware that PS3HEN exists for non-CFW models, but you don't need that. Just:<br />
- On PS3, copy game savedata to USB flash drive;
- With the flash drive on your PC, use a tool to decrypt the save files;
- Use Senki Savedata Editor to open decrypted SAVEDATA file and change whatever you want;
- After saving the file, go back to the decryption tool and re-encrypt the files;
- Copy back the savedata to your PS3.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## For RPCS3

RPCS3 doesn't encrypt any savedata.<br />
RPCS3 should store savedata in a folder like the following example: `rpcs3\dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata\BLES01421-SAVEDATA0`

-----------------------------------------------------------
